                  The residential care industry faces a retention crisis. Caregivers leave not because they stop caring, but because administrative overload makes the job unsustainable. High turnover disrupts resident relationships and compromises care quality—the very things that drew caregivers to this profession.

                  Traditional care management is reactive—problems get addressed after they become obvious. But the best care is anticipatory, noticing subtle patterns before they become crises. This requires tracking countless details across multiple residents, something human memory can't reliably do at scale.

This enables truly personalized care plans that adapt to each resident's evolving needs, preferences, and goals—the kind of individualized attention that transforms institutional care into genuine support for human flourishing.

                  Regulatory compliance is essential for resident safety and facility viability, but compliance work often feels at odds with direct care. Caregivers spend hours preparing for audits, filling out forms, and documenting according to complex regulations—time that could be spent with residents.
