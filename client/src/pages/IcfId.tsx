      question: "How does Harmony ensure compliance with 42 CFR Part 483?",
      answer: "Guardian continuously monitors all operations against federal ICF-ID regulations, providing real-time alerts for any gaps. The system is updated automatically when regulations change, and generates survey-ready documentation packages on demand. Every feature is designed with CFR compliance built-in."
    },
    {
      question: "Can Harmony help with active treatment documentation?",
      answer: "Absolutely! Compass integrates active treatment directly into ISPs with measurable goals, and DocuBot allows staff to document active treatment delivery in real-time via voice. The system automatically tracks progress toward goals and alerts when activities are missed."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the implementation timeline for a 30-resident ICF-ID?",
      answer: "Most ICF-ID facilities are fully operational within 3-4 weeks. We provide white-glove migration support including ISP import, staff training (on-site or virtual), and dedicated QIDP training. You'll start seeing compliance improvements from week one."
    },
    {
      question: "Does Harmony integrate with our existing EHR or pharmacy system?",
      answer: "Yes! We offer API integrations with major EHR systems, pharmacy platforms, and state reporting portals. Our team handles the technical integration, and we can build custom integrations for your specific systems."
    },
    {
      question: "How does pricing work for larger ICF-ID facilities?",
      answer: "ICF-ID facilities typically use our Professional plan at $79/resident/month for 11-50 residents, or Enterprise plan at $99/resident/month for 50+ residents. Enterprise includes custom integrations, dedicated account management, and white-label options."
    },
    {
      question: "Can Harmony help us prepare for our annual survey?",
      answer: "Yes! Guardian maintains continuous survey readiness by monitoring all compliance areas 24/7. When a survey is announced, it generates a complete documentation package in minutes, identifies any gaps, and provides remediation guidance. Many facilities report zero deficiencies after implementing Harmony."
